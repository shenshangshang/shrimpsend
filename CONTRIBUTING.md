## Pull request guidelines

1. **One logical change per PR** — bug fix, feature, or docs; avoid mixing unrelated refactors.
2. **Describe the why** — link issues when applicable; include test/verification steps.
3. **Match existing style** — follow patterns in surrounding code; run formatters/linters for touched areas.
4. **No secrets** — never commit API keys, passwords, or production config; use `.env.example` and local ignored files.
5. **License & DCO** — you confirm you have the right to submit the code, license it under AGPL-3.0-or-later, and include `Signed-off-by` on every commit (see [DCO.md](DCO.md)).

### By area

| Area | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `backend/` | Java 17, Spring Boot; `./gradlew test` when touching server logic |
| `web/` | Next.js; `npm run lint` in `web/` |
| `app/` | Flutter; `flutter analyze` in `app/` |
| `shared/protocol.md` | Protocol changes need client + server alignment |
